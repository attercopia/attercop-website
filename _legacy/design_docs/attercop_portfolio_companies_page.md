## Introduction Section

### Meet PE Expectations. Exceed Market Standards.

**Your PE sponsors didn't invest for incremental improvement. They expect transformation.**

You're under pressure to deliver rapid growth, operational excellence, and a compelling exit story. AI isn't just an opportunity - it's essential for hitting your targets and justifying valuations.

But most AI initiatives fail. They take too long, cost too much, and deliver too little. POCs that never reach production. Consultants who don't understand PE timelines. Technology that doesn't scale.

**We're different.** We've transformed 50+ PE-backed companies. We understand your board's expectations, your timeline pressures, and your resource constraints. We don't build POCs - we build production systems that deliver measurable ROI within quarters, not years.

**Most importantly, we make you exit-ready.** Every AI capability we build is documented, governed, and designed to enhance your multiple.

## FAQ Section

### Common Questions from Portfolio Company Leaders

**Q: How do you differ from other AI consultancies?**

**Q: What if we don't have clean data?**

**Q: How do we justify the investment to our board?**
A: We provide board-ready business cases with clear ROI projections. Most clients achieve payback within 6 months. Quick wins fund the broader transformation.

**Q: Will our team be able to maintain what you build?**
A: Yes. Knowledge transfer is embedded throughout. We use standard technologies, provide full documentation, and ensure your team is capable before we leave.

**Q: Can you work with our existing technology stack?**
A: Absolutely. We integrate with, not replace, your current systems. Our solutions enhance your existing investments.

**Q: What happens after 100 days?**
A: You have production AI delivering value. Most clients continue with us on a lighter-touch basis for optimisation, scaling, and new use cases.
