## Introduction
**The Power of Connected Data**

Data in isolation tells you what. Connected data tells you why. Graph technologies reveal the hidden relationships, patterns, and insights that traditional approaches miss.

At Attercop, we believe graphs are central to AI evolution. They enable contextual understanding, improve decision-making, and provide the foundation for explainable AI. From knowledge graphs to graph neural networks, we help organisations harness the power of connections.

## Why Graphs Matter for AI

### Visual: Comparison Diagram

**Contextual Understanding**
Graphs enable AI to understand data in context, not isolation

**Improved Decision-Making**
Infer not just what is likely, but why

**Complex Relationships**
Ideal for domains where relationships matter as much as entities

**Scalability & Flexibility**
Seamlessly integrate structured and unstructured data

**Explainability & Trust**
Transparent reasoning paths for interpretable AI
