Visual: Timeline graphic from 2022 to present
```

### The Origin Story
```
[PLACEHOLDER: Founding Story]

2022: The Problem
After decades in enterprise technology, our founders saw the same pattern: 
Amazing AI potential wasted on POCs that never reached production.

The Insight
PE-backed companies need speed, not studies. They need builders, not advisors. 
They need systems that work, not promises of future value.

The Solution
Attercop was born: A different kind of AI company. One that guarantees 
production in 100 days. One that builds knowledge systems, not just data 
pipelines. One that understands PE timelines and pressures.
```

### Why Brighton?
```
Innovation Heritage
Brighton has been pushing boundaries since the 1800s. 
From the Royal Pavilion to Silicon Beach, it's a city that thinks differently.

The Seafront Inspiration
Our brand colours come from Brighton's iconic seafront - the sea green 
of the ocean, the deep teal of Victorian ironwork. Beauty and engineering combined.

Talent Hub
Connected to London, attractive to global talent, and home to a thriving 
tech ecosystem. The perfect base for building the future.
```

### Our Mission
```
To make enterprise AI actually work.

Not in years. In 100 days.
Not in POCs. In production.
Not for consultants. For operators.

## Our Approach Page

### Page URL
`/about/our-approach`

### Hero Section
```
Headline: The Attercop Method
Subheading: How We Deliver AI in 100 Days
Visual: Methodology diagram with four phases
```

### The 100-Day Framework
```
[Interactive Timeline Graphic]

Days 1-10: Discovery & Alignment
- Stakeholder interviews
- Data assessment
- Opportunity prioritisation
- Success metrics definition
Output: Go/No-Go decision

Days 11-40: Design & Build
- Architecture design
- Rapid prototyping
- User feedback loops
- Integration planning
Output: Working prototype

Days 41-70: Deploy & Integrate
- Production deployment
- System integration
- User training
- Process updates
Output: Live system

Days 71-100: Optimise & Scale
- Performance tuning
- Scale testing
- ROI validation
- Future planning
Output: Proven value
```

### Core Principles

#### Principle 1: Knowledge Over Data
```
Everyone has data. Few have knowledge.

We build systems that understand relationships, context, and meaning. 
Not just databases that store information.

Technologies: Neo4j, Knowledge Graphs, Semantic Layers
```

#### Principle 2: Agents Over Analytics
```
Analytics tell you what happened. Agents do something about it.

We deploy autonomous systems that act, not just analyse. 
24/7 operation without human intervention.

Technologies: LangChain, AutoGen, Custom Orchestration
```

#### Principle 3: Production Over POCs
```
POCs are where AI goes to die.

Every project goes to production. No exceptions. 
If we can't deliver production value in 100 days, we don't take the project.

Guarantee: Production or your money back
```
