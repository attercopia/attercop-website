## Notes on Changes

### What Changed
1. **Life Sciences** elevated from service to top-level industry vertical
2. **Services** page now focuses on 8 core delivery capabilities
3. **Navigation bar** reflects industry-focused approach
4. **For Portfolio Companies** renamed to **For Businesses** (cleaner)

### Why This Works Better
- Clearer distinction between capabilities (what we do) and industries (who we serve)
- Life Sciences gets appropriate prominence as a specialist vertical
- PE and Business audiences have clear entry points
- Services are positioned as cross-industry capabilities

### Implementation Priority
1. Update main navigation bar
2. Create Life Sciences page
3. Update Services page
4. Adjust internal linking
5. Update footer structure
6. Mobile menu adjustments
